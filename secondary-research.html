					<h5>Facts currently on the Rahab's Rope Website</h5>
									<ul class="alt">
										<li>Approximately 40 million people in slavery. Fastest growing crime in the world. 152 billion-dollar per year industry. India traffics more children than any other country.</li>
										<li>Every day in India, about two hundred girls and women are forced into the commercial sex trade.</li>
										<li>Every year, over four million women and children around the globe are trafficked into prostitution and slave labor.</li>

										<li>“As well at large, the facilitation of women's economic empowerment (via job training, job creation and income generation schemes) and women's ownership and control of productive resources, the development of more comprehensive social welfare networks, the enforcement of safe migration policies, and a zero-tolerance level for corruption are also needed.”</li>

						<h5>Irani Machado da Silva & Anuradha Sathiyaseelan | (2019) Emotional needs of women post-rescue from sex trafficking in India, Cogent Psychology, 6:1, 1631584, DOI: 10.1080/23311908.2019.1631584</h5>
									<ul class="alt">
										<li>Vulnerability is a pre-trafficking characteristic. Poor and uneducated girls are at higher risk of being trafficked (Williams, 2008).</li>
										<li>There are more than one million child prostitutes in India. Girls as young as seven years old are brought into the sex trade by abduction, treachery, and so on; landing in a position of forced prostitution (Cable News Network, 2009). Almost 1.2 million girls and children, mostly between ten to sixteen years old have fallen victim to sex trafficking in India (Schultz, 2012).</li>
										<li>The caste system worsens the problem because those who are trafficked into the sex trade come from underprivileged parts of Indian society (Joffres et al., 2008).</li>
										<li>Sex trafficking has become a billion-dollar business in the country. In Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai, eight or more men repeatedly rape small girls as young as nine years old every night (Gupta, 2012). India’s sex trafficking is thriving (“Sex Trafficking in India,” 2013).</li>

					<h4>Try to find recent innovations in your client's particular area. They could be technological, behavioral, or cultural. </h4>				

					<p>US Department of State :These efforts included identifying more victims and investigating and prosecuting more trafficking cases. In response to heightened vulnerabilities to trafficking as a result of the pandemic, the government allocated funding for the strengthening of existing and establishment of new Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) around the country, and media reported railway and transit police increased patrolling of transportation hubs to prevent and intercept perpetrators and victims of human trafficking…. The government modestly increased anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts, although efforts remained inadequate compared to the scale of the problem. <br> Cultural shifts against sex trafficking and towards feministic viewpoints have begun, but Caste systems are a generationally deep influence into society.  
						</p>
					
						<h4>Take a look at other solutions in your area. Which ones worked? Which ones didn’t? Are there any that feel similar to what you might design? Any solutions that have inspired you to make one of your own?</h4>
					<p>Solutions include governmental increase in anti-trafficking law enforcement (which is inadequate at this time), focus on rescuing children or younger generations, providing education as a means of prevention, economically defunding the billion dollar business that is sex trafficking, etc. <br> Other non-profits working in this field include Apne Aap, Angels in the Field, Rescue Foundation, and Prerana.</p>
					<p>None of these solutions feel similar to what I might design. Rahab’s Rope is the only non-profit organization I have found that directly sells (in America) the work that rescued women and children make in India. All of these organizations focus on educating women and children, providing healthcare, training in jobs, and much more, which is excellent and necessary work. Rahab’s Rope stands unique in that it provides this support hand-in-hand with awareness to other countries of this problem India is facing, and it does so with the direct handprint of products made by the people facing these deeply ingrained problems. </p>

					<h4>Is there any market data that you can dig up that may be relevant in helping you solve the design challenge?</h4>
					<p>Stating important facts and data such as the ones researched above on the Rahab’s Rope website and more specific ways Rahab’s Rope is working to solve these problems will certainly help in solving the design problem. The specific work Rahab’s Rope is doing in raising awareness, funding, and educational programs for the Rescued women and children is all good and necessary. Now we need a well-designed and organized site to house clarified information from the Rahab’s Rope organization. </p>
