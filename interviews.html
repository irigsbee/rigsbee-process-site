							<h4>User Interview One:</h4>
					<h5>Who are you? What do you do?</h5>
					<p>April Rigsbee, homemaker</p>

					<h5>What matters to you about a website?</h5>
					<p> Ease of useful information and navigation</p>

					<h5>How often do you make a decision based on a website’s look?</h5>
					<p>Often</p>

					<h5>Have you ever donated to/volunteered with an organization that was aiming to support victims of sex trafficking?</h5>
					<p>Yes</p>

					<h5>When searching for these organizations to donate to or volunteer with, what do you seek out first on their websites?</h5>
					<p> Credibility - accountability
					</p>

					<h5>Have you ever encountered or purchased items from a shop that sold wholesale or “Good Money” products?</h5>
					<p>Rahab's Rope</p>


					<h5>Have you encountered the Rahab’s Rope organization? If you answer yes, please describe your experiences with them.</h5>
					<p>Yes, we discovered their store in Clarkesville GA and we’re impressed. The store feels like a light airy market. The jewelry, baskets, linens, and specialty items are beautifully displayed and the story of Rahab’s Rope is also artfully displayed and very clear and easy to understand. It was exciting to see the work they were doing and to be able to support them authentically. We loved every item we purchased that day and went back to their website to buy more. 
					</p>


					<h5>When looking to get more information on this particular organization, where would you go first?</h5>
					<p>They have a website, and it’s easy to do a web search. </p>

					<h5>When navigating through their website, what stood out to you the most?</h5>
					<p>It is aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate to the store. </p>

					<h5>Anything you would like to add? </h5>
					<p> I hope that more companies like this are formed and thrive. Also - if you haven’t shopped with Rahab’s Rope, stop reading this and go!</p>

							<h4>User Interview Two:</h4>
					<h5>Who are you? What do you do?</h5>
					<p>Rachel Middleton, I am a Kinesiology PrePT major at Anderson University.
					</p>

					<h5>What matters to you about a website?</h5>
					<p> It needs to be visually appealing, easy to use, and appropriate for the specific business.</p>

					<h5>How often do you make a decision based on a website’s look?</h5>
					<p>Pretty often, I think that having a good website is a great way to get more business, and I think that a bad website is unprofessional. 
					</p>

					<h5>Have you ever donated to/volunteered with an organization that was aiming to support victims of sex trafficking?</h5>
					<p>Unfortunately, I have not been able to do so yet, but I hope to in the future. Currently, I am a broke college student, so I cannot donate money. I hope to donate money and time in the future.
					</p>

					<h5>When searching for these organizations to donate to or volunteer with, what do you seek out first on their websites?</h5>
					<p> I look for a call to action button if I am specifically looking to donate or volunteer. I would probably look at Instagram or TikTok to gain more information about them before actually going to their website.
					</p>

					<h5>Have you ever encountered or purchased items from a shop that sold wholesale or “Good Money” products?</h5>
					<p>I have experience in the wholesale industry. My mom owns a business, and she contacts other small business owners to help promote and sell her merchandise. I have not bought or been associated with any “Good Money” products.</p>


					<h5>Have you encountered the Rahab’s Rope organization? If you answer yes, please describe your experiences with them.</h5>
					<p>No, I have not.
					</p>


					<h5>When looking to get more information on this particular organization, where would you go first?</h5>
					<p>I would go to the about page first. I would probably look at Instagram or TikTok to gain more information about them before actually going to their website.</p>

					<h5>When navigating through their website, what stood out to you the most?</h5>
					<p>I cannot find the location to volunteer my time. The main page looks pretty good overall, but the more I looked on the page, the more difficult it was to navigate. The setup is also pretty bad when you go into the website further. The layout is very basic </p>

					<h5>Anything you would like to add? </h5>
					<p> n/a</p>

					<p>For my first interview, I chose my mother, because I knew she had encountered the Rahab’s Rope organization in the past. Then, I chose to ask someone who had expressed interest in giving/volunteering with organizations like Rahab’s Rope, but had not encountered them before. This way, I got the opportunity to hear from both someone who knew Rahab’s Rope, and someone who didn’t in regards to giving their opinions on the organization as well as the site. Both of these interviews were beneficial to me, as I realized that much of the “brand identity” of Rahab’s Rope was working well for it. From my mother’s perspective, as someone who has visited their brick and mortar shop, she saw the elements of their store reflected in their website, which she called “aesthetically pleasing”. The access from the organization’s homepage to their online store was easy to find. Comparatively, the organization and clarity of the rest of the site seem to fall short. My second interviewee, Rachel, explored the site interested in their volunteer and donation opportunities. While donation was accessible, she expressed difficulty in finding volunteer opportunities and complained about a lack of clarity on the information that she was looking for. She expressed a hope to work with them in the future, but perhaps once her options were made more clear. </p>
