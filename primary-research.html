					<p>These images come from my first encounter with Rahab's Rope. This is their physical store location in Clarkesville, GA. I did not know what the store or organization was until I saw the sign for the small shop on a main street in Clarkesville, and knowing Rahab from the Bible I was intruiged to go inside. Upon entering the store, the variety of colorful baskets, textiles, jewelry, and more create an aesthetic and welcoming shop. By each table of products was a printed card or two explaining that everything in the store is handmade by women and children who were previously victims to sex trafficking in India. Rahab's Rope works to provide food, shelter, and alternative jobs to sex workers in India.</p>

					<p>These next few images are collected from the Rahab's Rope website as it appears currently. I tried to collect as many screen captures as possible from the Home page, About page, Shop page, and Partner page. Each page has different links to more subpages of their own, which I also aimed to collect.</p>

					<p>Rahab's Rope really has two websites, one they consider to be their Main Ministry Website, and the other to be their online catalog. In my research I clicked as many links and buttons as I saw possible. Only one button to their Instagram turned out to be a dead link. Their Main website and Catalog maintain consistent aesthetics between the two, but both have similar issues with ineffective writing and disorganized pages. One of the bigger issues with user experience that I had was clicking through different pages, and the website generally staying the same. The top banner of images would change, but nothing else changed to indicate that I was looking at a part of the website that was different from the others.</p>

					<p>From my research in their website, it appears as though they are unafraid of white space and simplicity, but user experience seems to be unconsidered when structuring the site. The identity of Rahab's Rope as a brand is welcoming, Christian, and representative of the Indian women and children they are working with. Their goals are clearly stated in everything they do. The imagery used on the sites focuses on the women and children, the environments they live in, and the products they have handmade that are available for purchase through Rahab's Rope. The color scheme of white, lavender, periwinkle, and browns is very calming and approachable. Typefaces are mostly consistent, with a few random anomalies found on different pages of the site. Overall, there are many opportunities within the site for improvements.</p>

					<p>These are some examples of printed materials created for Rahab's Rope. Most of these printed materials are seen in the physical stores. They have many cards that were available in the store such as ones with details on a speficic handmade product, business cards, event or partnership opportunites, and more. These materials stick with the overall brand aesthetic of a calm approachability.</p>
