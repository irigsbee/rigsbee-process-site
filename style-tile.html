					</header>

					<h4>Style Tile Design</h4>
					<div class="image fit card">
						<img src="./images/styletile images/rr_styletile_final.jpg" alt="Styletile" />
					</div>

					<p>My style tile for the Rahab's Rope website is meant to visualize the key words "warm, inviting, comforting, personal, and empowering". I based the color palette on the colors that Rahab's Rope already had in place (lavender and a dark brown), but with the addition of  variations for these colors.  The left side of the style tile is meant to give an idea of how the homepage of the website would appear, with the primary CTA underneath a header photo, along with a reorganized menu bar.</p>

					
					<h4>Call-to-Action Designs</h4>
					<div class="image fit card">
						<img src="./images/styletile images/rr_CTAs_final.png" alt="Call-to-Actions"/>
					</div>

					<p>These Call to Actions were selected based on the main goal that drive the Rahab’s Rope website. Not only are they bringing awareness to the problems they are seeking to help, but they are presenting different ways that people can help support their mission. Since this is the organizations main site, the first way for users to engage with the site is through donations. This is the primary CTA that should be visible on the page. The secondary CTA is a reference to the Rahab’s Rope shop (both online and brick and mortar). Rahab’s Rope specializes in Good Money opportunities for survivors of sex trafficking to find new work after leaving the sex work industry. By directing users to the shop, it not only benefits the user, but it directly supports the women that Rahab’s Rope is outreaching to. The last CTA is “Partner”, which acts as an all encompassing way for volunteers, small businesses, and others to find ways to work with Rahab’s Rope in the fight against sex trafficking. Other CTAs found in the menu bar include “About”, which would simply contain more information about the work and beliefs of the organization, while “stories” would contain an archive of information on the impact Rahab’s Rope has made through the stories of survivors, volunteers, and more. </p>

					</div>

					<p>I also redesigned the Rahab's Rope logo, from an overly complicated design to a simpler look. Instead of using a mandala flower and rope like they had used before, I chose to use a lotus flower, which is not only significant in Indian culture as a symbol of purity, but it is a symbol of rebirth and regeneration, which I believe is an important representation of the work Rahab's Rope does.</p>
